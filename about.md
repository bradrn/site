# About

This is the personal website of me, @bradrn.
I am interested in areas including programming, linguistics, mathematics, chemistry, physics and music,
  and hope to share my thoughts here.
Mostly I go by `bradrn`, though where that’s unavailable I’m `brdrcn` instead.

The site logo is the English word *script* transliterated into the Javanese script (*aksara Jawa*),
  as <span style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;display:inline-block">ꦱꦼꦏꦿꦶꦥ꧀</span> (in Latin transcription *sekrip*).
It is typeset in the font ‘Bakul’, by Aditya Baya Perdana ([Bēhance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/111010691/Javanese-font-Bakul), [download link](https://aksaradinusantara.com/fonta/ab-bakul.font)).
The term *script* is used prominently in both linguistics and programming;
  furthermore, I have long admired the aesthetic of Javanese script, one of the closest indigenous scripts to where I live.
(And, of course, its substring ‘Java’ is known from programming too…)
